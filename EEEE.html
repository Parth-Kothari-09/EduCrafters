            A circuit is a path for current to flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal (with the
            electrons flowing in the opposite direction). DC circuits can be in series or parallel mode. A series DC
            circuit is connected end to end for making up a path for flowing current. In parallel DC circuits,
            electrical components are connected in a way one end of the component is connected to the common point and
            the other end is connected to another common point.

            A DC circuit, like any other circuit, is a closed path for current to flow. The only thing different in this
            circuit is that the circuit uses a direct current which flows in only one direction. DC circuits are mostly
            used for simple applications.
            <br><br>
            Direct Current is the current that has a unidirectional flow of electric charge. In this current, the direction and magnitude of the current remain constant throughout. DC is a scalar quantity. This is because direct current represents the value of current and flows in one direction only. Direct current finds its use in many household devices and in all devices that use batteries.
